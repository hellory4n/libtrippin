# Engineerâ„¢

Got so annoyed at Make that I made my own build system.

This works by pretty much just being Make, but in Lua. (no esoteric language)

## FAQ

### Isn't that just Premake?

No they're quite different, the only thing in common is Lua.

### Have you tried \[build system] you fucking moron?

No fuck off.
